    <h2>Desciption</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Paneer Butter Masala</strong> is a classic
      <em>North Indian dish</em> that brings together creamy textures and bold
      flavors in every bite. Soft cubes of <strong>paneer</strong> are gently
      fried to golden perfection before being simmered in a silky, aromatic
      <em>tomato-based gravy</em> enriched with
      <em>butter, cream, and a blend of warm spices</em>. The combination of
      <em>ginger, garlic, red chili, cumin, and garam masala</em> creates a
      harmony of spice and sweetness, perfectly balanced by the smoothness of
      <em>cashews and cream</em>. Whether served with naan, roti, or a bowl of
      steamed rice, this restaurant-style
      <strong>Paneer Butter Masala</strong> captures the essence of indulgent
      <strong>Indian</strong> comfort food.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
      <li>½ pound paneer, cut into ½-inch cubes</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>2 onions, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ginger paste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garlic paste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon ground cashews</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground red chiles</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground coriander</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon garam masala</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
      <li>½ cup half-and-half</li>
      <li>½ cup milk</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon white sugar</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat ½ cup of vegetable oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the paneer
        cubes and fry until they turn light golden on all sides. Remove them
        from the oil and place on paper towels to drain any excess oil. Set
        aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the same pan, melt 2 tablespoons of butter. Add the finely chopped
        onions and sauté until they turn golden brown. Stir in the ginger paste
        and garlic paste, and cook for another minute until fragrant.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix in the ground cashews, red chili powder, cumin, coriander, and garam
        masala. Stir well and cook for about 1–2 minutes to release the flavors.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in the tomato sauce and cook for 5–7 minutes, stirring
        occasionally, until the sauce thickens slightly and the oil begins to
        separate from the sides.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce the heat to low. Add the half-and-half and milk, stirring
        continuously to create a smooth, creamy gravy. Mix in the sugar and
        salt, and simmer gently for another 3–4 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gently add the fried paneer cubes to the sauce. Stir well so that all
        pieces are coated evenly in the rich gravy. Simmer for 5 minutes on low
        heat, allowing the paneer to absorb the flavors.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn off the heat and let it rest for a few minutes. Garnish with a
        swirl of cream or a small pat of butter and a sprinkle of fresh
        coriander leaves. Serve hot with naan, roti, or basmati rice.
      </li>
    </ol>
