    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Chole Curry</strong>, also known as
      <strong>Punjabi Chana Masala</strong>, is a hearty and flavorful North
      <em>Indian dish</em> made with tender <strong>chickpeas</strong> simmered
      in a <em>spicy, tangy</em> <strong>tomato-onion gravy</strong>. Infused
      with aromatic spices like
      <strong>cumin, coriander, turmeric, and garam masala</strong>, this dish
      is a beautiful balance of heat and warmth. The slow-cooked chickpeas
      absorb all the rich flavors of the masala, creating a thick, satisfying
      curry that pairs perfectly with
      <strong>bhature, puri, or steamed basmati rice</strong>. Often enjoyed as
      a weekend indulgence or festive meal, Chole Curry <em>captures</em> the
      essence of <em>traditional</em> Indian comfort food — wholesome, aromatic,
      and deeply satisfying.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <div class="container">
      <ul class="myUL">
      <li>2 cups water</li>
      <li>1 tea bag</li>
      <li>1 bay leaf</li>
      <li>2 (15.5 ounce) cans garbanzo beans, drained</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>
      <li>1 onion, sliced</li>
      <li>3 tomatoes, chopped</li>
      <li>¼ cup fresh cilantro leaves</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger root</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon grated garlic</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric (Optional)</li>
      <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>ground cayenne pepper, to taste</li>
      <li>1 pinch garam masala (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a medium saucepan, bring 2 cups of water to a boil. Add the tea bag
        and bay leaf, then stir in the drained garbanzo beans. Let it simmer for
        about 10 minutes to let the flavors infuse and to soften the chickpeas
        slightly. Discard the tea bag and bay leaf, then set the chickpeas
        aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add
        the sliced onion and sauté until golden brown. Stir in the chopped
        tomatoes and cook until they soften and the oil begins to separate from
        the mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the grated ginger and garlic, and cook for about a minute until
        fragrant. Then, mix in the ground coriander, cumin seeds, turmeric (if
        using), cayenne pepper, and a pinch of garam masala. Stir well to coat
        the mixture in the spices.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the cooked chickpeas into the masala mixture, stirring to combine.
        Add a little water if needed to reach your desired curry consistency.
        Let it simmer for 10–15 minutes, allowing the chickpeas to absorb all
        the rich flavors of the masala.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a separate small pan, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil and
        sauté the finely chopped onion until golden. Add this as a tadka
        (tempering) over the curry for extra depth of flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn off the heat and sprinkle fresh cilantro leaves over the top. Serve
        your flavorful Chole Curry hot with rice, roti, or fluffy bhature.
      </li>
    </ol>
