    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Gulab Jamun is one of India’s most beloved desserts — soft,
      melt-in-your-mouth balls soaked in a fragrant rose-flavored sugar syrup.
      Made from milk solids (khoya or milk powder) and a hint of cardamom, these
      golden dumplings are deep-fried slowly until they turn a rich caramel
      brown, then immersed in warm syrup infused with rose water and saffron.
      The result is a dessert that’s delicately sweet, aromatic, and comforting
      in every bite. Whether served warm or chilled, Gulab Jamun is a festive
      favorite that brings a touch of celebration to every occasion — from
      weddings to family gatherings.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup milk powder</li>
      <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour (maida)</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter)</li>
      <li>2&hyphen;3 tablespoons milk (or as needed to form a soft dough)</li>
      <li>Oil or ghee, for deep frying</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups sugar</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups water</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon cardamom powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon rose water (optional, for aroma)</li>
      <li>A few saffron strands (optional, for flavor and color)</li>
      <li>Chopped pistachios or almonds</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a saucepan, combine 1 ½ cups sugar and 1 ½ cups water. Heat on medium
        flame, stirring until the sugar dissolves completely. Add cardamom
        powder, rose water, and saffron strands (if using). Let it simmer for
        5–7 minutes until slightly sticky but not thick. Turn off the heat and
        keep the syrup warm.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a mixing bowl, combine milk powder, all-purpose flour, and baking
        soda. Add ghee and mix gently with your fingers until the mixture
        becomes crumbly. Gradually add milk — one tablespoon at a time — and
        knead lightly to form a soft, smooth, and slightly sticky dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide the dough into small equal portions and roll them into smooth,
        crack-free balls.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil or ghee in a deep pan over low to medium heat. Drop a small
        piece of dough to test — it should rise slowly without browning too
        fast. Gently add the dough balls and fry, stirring continuously, until
        they turn evenly golden brown. Remove and drain on paper towels.
      </li>
      <li>
        Immediately transfer the hot fried jamuns into the warm sugar syrup. Let
        them soak for at least 1–2 hours, allowing them to absorb the syrup and
        become soft and juicy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Garnish with chopped pistachios or almonds. Serve warm or chilled — both
        ways are irresistibly delicious!
      </li>
    </ol>
